# src/lean4/lakefile.lean

## Overview
The `src/lean4/lakefile.lean` file is the build configuration script for the Lean 4 project named "clever". It is used by `lake`, Lean's official build system and package manager, to understand the project's structure, compile its source files, manage dependencies, and define build targets. This file essentially instructs `lake` on how to build the "clever" software.

## Key Components
The `lakefile.lean` uses a Domain Specific Language (DSL) provided by Lake to define the build configuration. Key parts of this file include:

- **`import Lake` and `open Lake DSL`**:
    - These lines import the necessary Lake modules and open the DSL namespace, making Lake's configuration commands directly available.

- **`package «clever» where ...`**:
    - This block defines the main package for the project, named "clever".
    - **`leanOptions := #[ ⟨\`autoImplicit, false⟩ ]`**: This is a specific configuration for the Lean compiler when building this package. It sets the `autoImplicit` option to `false`. This means that the compiler will not automatically infer implicit arguments for functions and definitions; they must be declared explicitly. This can make code more verbose but often clearer and less prone to certain types of errors.

- **`require mathlib from git "https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4" @ "v4.15.0"`**:
    - This line declares an external dependency on the `mathlib4` library, which is a comprehensive library of formalized mathematics for Lean 4.
    - `mathlib`: The local name given to this dependency.
    - `from git "..."`: Specifies that `mathlib4` should be fetched from the given GitHub repository URL.
    - `@ "v4.15.0"`: This is a crucial part that "pins" the dependency to a specific version (tag `v4.15.0`) of `mathlib4`. This ensures that the project always builds against this exact version, providing reproducibility and stability.

- **`@[default_target] lean_lib «clever» where ...`**:
    - This block defines a Lean library target named "clever".
    - `@[default_target]`: This attribute marks the "clever" library as the default target. When a user runs `lake build` without specifying a particular target, Lake will build this library.
    - **`globs := #[.submodules \`Imports, .submodules \`human_eval, .submodules \`sample_examples]`**: This directive tells Lake where to find the source files (`.lean` files) for the "clever" library. It specifies that all Lean files within the subdirectories named `Imports`, `human_eval`, and `sample_examples` are part of this library. These directories likely contain:
        - `Imports`: Common import files or utility definitions for the project.
        - `human_eval`: Lean files related to human evaluation tasks or problems.
        - `sample_examples`: Lean files containing sample problems or examples.

## Important Variables/Constants
In the context of a `lakefile.lean`, these are more like configuration parameters:

- **Package Name**: `«clever»` - The name of the Lean package.
- **Lean Compiler Options (`leanOptions`)**:
    - `autoImplicit := false`: A specific compiler behavior setting.
- **Dependency URIs and Revisions**:
    - `mathlib` git URL: `https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4`
    - `mathlib` version: `v4.15.0`
- **Library Source Locations (`globs`)**: The paths (`Imports`, `human_eval`, `sample_examples`) that define the content of the main library.

## Usage Examples
This file is not "run" or "imported" in the way a typical Python or Lean source file is. Instead, it is used by the `lake` command-line tool. Here's how it's typically used from a terminal within the `src/lean4/` directory (which is the root of this Lean project):

- **`lake build`**:
    - This command instructs Lake to build the default target, which is the `«clever»` library defined in this file. Lake will:
        1. Read `lakefile.lean`.
        2. Download and build `mathlib v4.15.0` if it hasn't been built already with these settings.
        3. Compile all `.lean` files found in the `Imports`, `human_eval`, and `sample_examples` directories, using the `autoImplicit := false` option.
        4. Place compiled artifacts (e.g., `.olean` files) into the `build` directory.

- **`lake clean`**:
    - This command removes the `build` directory, cleaning up compiled files.

- **`lake update`**:
    - This command would attempt to update dependencies to their latest compatible versions, but since `mathlib` is pinned to a specific revision (`v4.15.0`), `lake update mathlib` would only change something if the `lakefile.lean` itself was modified to a different revision.

- **`lake lean <file_name>`**:
    - This command can be used to compile a single Lean file, for example, `lake lean human_eval/problem_1.lean`. It would still respect the package configurations and dependencies defined in `lakefile.lean`.

## Dependencies and Interactions
- **Lean 4 Toolchain**: This `lakefile.lean` requires a working Lean 4 installation, as `lake` is part of Lean 4.
- **`mathlib4` (version `v4.15.0`)**: The "clever" package explicitly depends on this specific version of the Mathlib 4 library. The source code within the `Imports`, `human_eval`, and `sample_examples` directories can use any definitions and theorems provided by this version of `mathlib`.
- **File System Structure**: The `globs` directive means this `lakefile.lean` expects subdirectories named `Imports`, `human_eval`, and `sample_examples` to exist and contain the project's Lean source files.
- **Git**: `lake` uses `git` in the background to fetch dependencies like `mathlib` from Git repositories.
